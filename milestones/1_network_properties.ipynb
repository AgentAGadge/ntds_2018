    "The purpose of this milestone is to start getting acquainted to the network that you will use for this class. In the first part of the milestone you will import your data using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and you will create the adjacency matrix using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org). This part is project specific. In the second part you will have to compute some basic properties of your network. **For the computation of the properties you are only allowed to use the packages that have been imported in the cell below.** You are not allowed to use any graph-specific toolboxes for this milestone (such as networkx and PyGSP). Furthermore, the aim is not to blindly compute the network properties, but to also start to think about what kind of network you will be working with this semester. "

Be curious and explore other distances as well! For instance, in the case of high-dimensional feature vectors, you might want to consider using the cosine distance.

Use the above developed function to compute the diameter of the graph (or the diameter of the largest connected component of the graph if the graph is not connected). If your graph (or largest connected component) is very large, computing the diameter will take very long. In that case downsample your graph so that it has 1.000 nodes. There are many ways to reduce the size of a graph. For the purposes of this milestone you can chose to randomly select 1.000 nodes. "

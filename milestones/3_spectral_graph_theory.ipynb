    "* Textual answers shall be short. Typically one to two sentences.\n",
    "* Code has to be clean.\n",
    "* You cannot import any other library than we imported.\n",
    "* When submitting, the notebook is executed and the results are stored. I.e., if you open the notebook again it should show numerical results and plots. We won't be able to execute your notebooks.\n",
    "* The notebook is re-executed from a blank state before submission. That is to be sure it is reproducible. You can click \"Kernel\" then \"Restart & Run All\" in Jupyter."

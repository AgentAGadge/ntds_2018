Milestone 2: network models

Limit your textual answers to 1-2 sentences.

Create a function that constructs an Erdos-Renyi graph. 
Use the function to create a random ER graph. Choose the parameters such that number of nodes is the same as in your graph, and the number od edges similar. Comment on your choice of parameters. 

Create a function that constructs an Barabasi-Albert graph. 
Use the function to create a random Barabasi-Albert graph. Choose the parameters such that number of nodes is the same as in your graph, and the number od edges similar. Comment on your choice of parameters. 

Compare your network with the two random networks using network properties from the last milestone. Comment 

Compare node distributions with KL divergence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence)
If the node distributions were the same, would we be talking about the same graphs? Explain.

Choose a network model (you can check the course materials) that fits you network best. Explain your choice. 
Create a random graph from that model. Choose the parameters such that number of nodes is the same as in your graph, and the number od edges similar. You are allowed to use additional libraries here (eg. NetworkX), but you have to explain in short how the model works. Explain your choice in a few words.
